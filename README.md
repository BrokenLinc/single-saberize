# single-saberize
Creates single-saber maps from normal Beat Saber maps.

### How?
It duplicates **all** custom songs you have downloaded, adds "(Single Saber)" to the name and makes **all** difficulty levels single-saber. It does this by removing all red blocks or repainting them blue if they seem hittable.

### Instructions
Download the [latest release of single-saberizer.exe](/releases/latest), place it in your `Beat Saber` program directory (usually in `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common`), and run it.
